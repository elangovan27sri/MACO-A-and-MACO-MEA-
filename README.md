# MACO-A-and-MACO-MEA-
run distance.py file for both algorithm

for changing obstacles environment for maco-a*, go to distance.py file from line 33 to 38, and for points go to data folder.

for changing obstacles environment for maco-mea*, go to distance.py file from line 33 to 38, and also using the matlab code for mea* (https://github.com/iram218/iram218) find the obstacles avoided path, then store them as txt file in folder meastr_data/5obstpaths as I did for 5 obstacles path.

results will follows like this, first the energy model of UAV with obstacle avoided cost will calculate..then the ant moves over the cost matrix calculated then the plot and path will come..
